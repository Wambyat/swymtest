       "  \"I was so excited to get this jumpsuit. There are several cute colors to choose from. I decided to pick with my favorite color to wear black since its supposed to be a slimming color. This jumpsuit runs very small. I ordered a much larger size than normal and it still didn't work for me. I do have a hard time with one pieces like this because I am fairly tall. I have a long torso and long legs, not to mention a large bust. Unfortunately this top did not have enough room for me. When I pulled it up where it needed to be, the crotch was too tight. So I probably needed to go to an even larger size which is a size that I would never have to order in anything else. I normally would wear a large or XL in most clothes. I ordered a 2X in this jumpsuit. These problems can all be corrected by just ordering another size up. One other thing about this jumpsuit is its not a great length for tall people. While I wear around a 33 inseam, this jumpsuit has a 29 inseam. Its very short on me.\\n\\nMeasurements for 2X\\n\\nTop Elastic Band: 12.75 wide and 2.375 tall\\n\\nTop/Chest Area: 17 wide and 12 tall\\n\\nWaist Band: 13.5 wide and 1.75tall\\n\\nInseam: 29\\n\\nBottom Leg Width: 17.5 wide\\n\\nOther than the sizing problems, this jumpsuit is really soft and lightweight. I love the wide leg with the cut hem on the bottom. I ended up giving this to my sister who is much shorter than me. She really loves how comfortable it is. It definitely looks much better on her. I just don't think my body frame is made for a one piece. I really wanted this to work for me. So make sure you order probably a couple sizes larger than normal and make sure a 29 inseam is long enough for you. Im not basing my review on it not fitting my body but rather how this actually fits on the appropriate body type. This is really adorable with a cute belt. This can be casual wear or even dress it up. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\",\n",

The lace on the bottom is free flowing and is not attached to the underlay.\\n\\nThere is a loop string on both side of the dress to hold the ribbon. The ribbon can be tied in the front or back. You can also remove the ribbon if needed. The loops on the side blend in with the dress so its not noticeable.\\n\\nThe back of the dress has a 22 metal zipper with a metal pull.

The dress is very comfortable and soft against your skin. Its not too thin but not too thick either. You are not able to see through it. The material allows for a good amount of stretch.\\n\\nThe design of this dress is more of a high waist dress. The fitted top ends slightly below the bust area and not right underneath it.

       "  'Bracelets are a great way to dress up any outfit. This mesh bracelet is prefect for everyday wear and for special occasions. My bracelet arrived in a mesh drawstring bag inside of a jewelry box.\\n\\nThe bracelet is rhodium plated but looks like real silver. It consists of three separate bands. The outside of the bracelet has a flat silver band on each side. They are about 1/8 wide. These bands are intertwined with a silver mesh band. This mesh band is rounded on the top and flat on the bottom. Its approximately 5/16 wide. The bands crossover at the ends and are secured by a decorative end cap.\\n\\nI really love the design of this cuff bracelet. I have fairly small wrists and have a problem with most bracelets being too large. I am able to slight bend this bracelet to fit my wrist perfectly. It also prevents it from falling off. I can easily widen it when Im ready to take it off. Bending it has not caused any damage to the bracelet at all. Ive been wearing it for over a month and it has not turned colors. I like to keep polishing cloths in my jewelry box so I can keep my jewelry looking like new. Im very happy with the way this bracelet is made and how well it goes with everything. I definitely would recommend this gorgeous cuff bracelet. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.',\n",

Overall, the size of this bag is approximately 13.5H x 16W x 7.5D. The bottom of the bag is flat so it will stand up straight. This also makes the top portion of the bag expand to be slightly wider if needed. It can expand out to around 21 wide. It just all depends on how much you have inside the bag. Theres one side pouch which has an 8 wide opening and is about 7.75 deep. The bag has double blue handles that are 1.5 wide. I like that the handles are folded at the top which makes it more comfortable to carry. The handles are also long enough so you can carry the bag on your shoulder.\\n\\nThe top of the bag is mainly open. The middle has a metal swivel clip on one side which can be connected to the d-ring on the other side. This will give some type of closure on the bag. The bag has an of white cotton lining. One side features a zipper pocket with a brown pleather pull. It has a 9.5 opening and is about 7 deep. Below this pocket is a pleather tag with the brand name La Cle on it. The other side of the bag has two pouches.\\n\\nThe bag has good quality material. Its fairly thick material and seems durable. You can fit lots of things into this large bag. Its great for going to the beach or pool. You can fold or roll up a couple of towels, along with some sun lotions, flip flops, and more. You can even hide your cell phone in the large zipper pocket. There are so many uses for this bag so its great to have around the house. I think it would be adorable monogrammed.  I would definitely recommend this stylish bag.

However, the color is different. Its still a blue shade but slightly different than the rest of the dress. I love that the material is double layered because I don't have to wear a bra. The back of the dress has an 18 long invisible zipper. So you can step into the dress or slide it over your head. I was able to zip it up by myself but some may need help.

The bracelet and charms seem to be very durable. The gold is bold but I don't like the mix of the silver glass beads and the silver bracelet with it. This definitely needs to have a gold bracelet. It just throws of the look to me. Other than that, its very pretty. It would make a great gift option for a teen or adult.

       "  'This Lace Butterfly Tube Bra Top is adorable but its definitely not for the larger busted woman. It runs really small. Lying flat, it measures 11 wide but it does have a good amount of stretch to it. The top can probably stretch out to 16 wide. The material is super soft. It is a bit thin so it should probably be worn underneath another top. I love the gorgeous butterfly lace on the back. This top would be a great addition to many wardrobes, especially something strapless or with the back out. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.',\n",

       "  'This rose gold heart necklace is tiny but gorgeous. The heart pendant is approximately  x 5/8. It may be on the smaller side but its full of sparkle. The pendant is loaded with shiny crystals. It definitely has a look of a real gold and diamond necklace.\\n\\nThere is a small decorative hole in the pendant for the chain to go through. I really like the design of this. It makes the heart dangle at an angle. The rose gold chain is very dainty yet durable. Its 16 long plus it has a 2.5 extender with a decorative tag at the end. I love extenders because you adjust the length to the desired position so it will fit perfectly with your top. The chain also has a small lobster claw clasp and is easy to get ahold of. The pictures do not do this necklace justice. This is definitely a must see in person. It looks like a high end piece of jewelry. I truly love it. This comes in a gift box and would make an excellent gift option for a loved one. Its simply stunning!

       "  'I will say that I absolutely love this handbag by Yahoho. It definitely looks much better in person. You can tell that this purse is made from real leather. The brown leather is textured and super soft. The purse has some adorable gold hardware which make this purse unique.\\n\\nThe overall size of this purse is approximately 16 L x 10 H X 5 W. The base of the purse is almost 13.5 inches but I based the length on the widest part. The sides of the purse is kind of scrunched together with a buckle so the bottom extends out a little more. The top of the buckle has a gold d-ring where the included strap can be attached. Theres an adjustable strap that you can use with this purse to turn it into a shoulder bag. The strap adjusts by a gold buckle and the strap has 5 holes.\\n\\nI actually prefer just using the handles. There are two padded handles that are attached by gold metal links. I really love the unique design of the gold metal swivels where the handles attach to the purse. It pinches the leather together and gives it a more dimensional appearance. The swivels allow the handles to drop properly in place.\\n\\nThe top of the purse features a gold zipper with a large gold pull. Inside the purse is chocolate brown. The lining has a water repellent material so its really easy to wipe clean. The backside has a 6.5 zipper pocket. In front of this zipper pocket is an 8.5 pouch with a zipper pocket. The other side has an 8 side pocket. Theres a 4 hard flat bottom. Theres plenty of room in this purse to fit almost anything that you need. You can even slide your tablet in along with your wallet and makeup bag. The side pouch is great for things like my calendar book and phone so I can quickly find it when needed.\\n\\nThe back of the purse features a 7 zipper pocket. It has a gold zipper with a large gold pull. It has the same lining as the inside of the purse. The pocket is about 4.5 tall. I like to use this pocket for shopping receipts or other personal notes.\\n\\nI received a nice dust bag with my purse. This is great to help keep it clean when storing. I absolutely love this purse. The leather is very nice and the colors are gorgeous. This unique looking purse is perfect for me. I highly recommend this Yahoho leather purse.

       "  'This dress is gorgeous. I ordered this to wear to my husbands company Christmas party. It looks much better than expected. This dress has two layers. I believe the lining is polyester and may have a small mix of spandex because it is very stretchy. The outer layer is chiffon and has some lace. This dress is very comfortable yet sexy also.\\n\\nMeasurements for XL\\n\\nChest: 19 wide\\n\\nWaist: 16.5 wide\\n\\nSleeve Length: 23 long (from shoulder seam)\\n\\nLength: 56 long (from shoulder to bottom hem)\\n\\nThe front of the dress has a low cut cross-over V-neck. The chest area has some ruching. The shoulders and arms have a gorgeous lace design. Im pleasantly surprised that the lace sleeves are not tight at all. I can easily move around and be comfortable. It has a small amount of stretch to it. The bottom of the sleeves have a unique look with a scalloped edge and some fraying.\\n\\nUnder the chest area is more decorative lace that goes all the way around the dress. The lace is approximately 1.5 wide. There is about a 27 slit up the right leg. Its a straight cut and not opened. In other words the dress still closes and does not have an open gap. Theres some ruching under the lace band which gives the bottom of the dress a great amount of flow. This also helps to keep the slit closed more because theres more fabric. Im not one to show my legs but I do feel comfortable with the way this dress is made.\\n\\nThe back is very sexy yet still conservative. The upper portion of the back is the same lace that continues from the shoulders and arms. Underneath this lace is more chiffon with ruching. The back closes by a single gold button that is attached to the back of the lace. This gold button fits into a loop to close. This can be difficult to undo sometimes but I eventually get it done. Underneath is like a thin oval opening back. Below this is an 11 invisible zipper.\\n\\nThe bottom of the dress have a very tiny hem and the stitching is superb. The length of this dress is perfect on me. I can wear flat or heels. This dress looks amazing dressed up with some nice jewelry. I wore this to a small event recently and cant wait to dress it up more for my husbands company Christmas party in a few weeks. I received lots of compliments and it was really comfortable to wear for the several hours that I had it on. I love all the beautiful details and how sexy yet classy it looks. I am very happy with this dress and I would recommend it for any special occasion. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.',\n",

       "  'This pearl necklace by Smitco LLC is very gorgeous. Its simple yet elegant. This necklace looks great as every day wear but it also has a sophisticated look so its perfect when dressing up for a special occasion. My necklace arrived in a purple gift box so its ready to give as a gift to a loved one.\\n\\nThe necklace set is very lightweight weighing about .2oz however its very thick and sturdy. The pendant is about 7/8 long and about .5 wide at the bottom. The pendant resembles a J or S shape. The top portion features seven crystals. The bottom portion features eleven crystals and has an ivory pearl set in the middle. I love that the pendant is 3 dimensional. The backside of the pendant is solid silver.\\n\\nThe chain slides through a large metal loop on the backside of the pendant. This gives the necklace an expensive look because it does not have a cheap looking loop attached to the top of the pendant. The chain is a box chain and the silver really shines. The chain that I received is 16 with a 2 extender that has an SCO tag on the end. It also has a medium sized lobster claw clasp which is easy to open. I do with the extender links were a bit larger as it can be difficult sometimes to get the clasp attached. My clasp also sticks sometimes so I have to be sure it closes all the way. Other than that, I have not experienced any other problems. The necklace is very gorgeous and compliments any outfit.

       "  'I ordered this Tshirt Dress in grey. However, the color is taupe. Its made with 95% cotton and 5% spandex. The material is very lightweight but not see though. Its extremely comfortable like an oversized tshirt. I ordered the largest size that was available at the time which is a Large. It does fit snug in the stomach area so an XLarge would have fit much better. My bust is about 40 around and I wear a 38D. The top portion fits ok but I like my tops fairly loose.\\n\\nThis top does have a good amount of stretch to it. I really like the tshirt neckline so its not low-cut. The sleeves are long and loose fitting. They hit right at my elbows and they have a 1 fold over cuff. The cuff is only attached in the under seam. So you may have to press down the sleeves for them to stay folded.\\n\\nMeasurements of Large\\n\\nChest: 19.75 wide\\n\\nWaist: 17.5 wide\\n\\nSleeves: 10 long\\n\\nLength: 32 long\\n\\nTheres a straight hem with double stitching. This length might make a good dress for those that are petite. However, for tall people like myself, its best to wear as a tunic. This is a fairly basic top so it can be worn in many ways. You can leave it long and wear with leggings. You can even scrunch it up around the waist and pair it with jeans. Another great way is to dress it up with a cardigan. Its a great versatile top. Being lightweight, you can wear it year around because a cardigan can be worn over it for cooler month. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.',\n",
